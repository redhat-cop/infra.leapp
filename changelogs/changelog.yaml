    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed common role to resolve incorrect timestamps in log files
      - Fixed os_path is undefined error in upgrade role
      minor_changes:
      - Add the default variables async_timeout_maximum and async_poll_interval which
        configure the timeout and polling values respectively for asynchronous task
        execution. - Setting async/poll values as default vars will allow override
        timer values based on the end user's particular needs.
      - Set the default to "disabled" in the selinux_mode default variable - This
        resolves an issue with a missing Ansible fact for servers where selinux is
        disabled

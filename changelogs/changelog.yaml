      minor_changes:

        resolves an issue with a missing Ansible fact for servers where selinux is

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Adding required collections as dependencies to galaxy.yml file now that is
        working better
      - Also adding all community.general modules to ansible-lint config to mock them

  1.7.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Add leapp_infra_upgrade_system_roles_collection to roles where it's applicable.
        Both to README and defaults/main.yml.
      - Add parameter leapp_remediate_ssh_password_auth with default value true to
        remediate role.

        support
      - Ensure that unsupported kernel modules are unloaded before running leapp upgrade.
      - Fix configuring local_repos_leapp yum repositories file. Previously, it was
        hardcoded to __leapp_repo_file regardless of whether file key was provided
        with one of local_repos_leapp
      - Fixed Satellite registration handling.
      - Fixed task responsible for removing package version locks that would fail
        if versionlock sub-command for dnf/yum was not available.
      - Fixing CI workflow to rebuild collection for Automation Hub using redhat.rhel_system_roles
        collection as dependency.
      - The default leapp_remediate_ssh_password_auth true might lock out your Ansible
        session and the play will
      - The leapp_inhibitors variable is sometimes not defined
      - The reboot module does use the `timeout` keyword.  Do not worry about 2.9
        support.
      - This parameter is used to determine whether to remediate SSH password authentication
        by setting PasswordAuthentication to no
      - Use the split string method instead of the filter for 2.9 support.
      - and PermitRootLogin to prohibit-password.
      - fail if you are using Ansible with ssh and password authentication.
      - fixed missing leapp package when upgrade role is run without running the analysis
        role first
      - version locking dependencies for community.general to be less than 12"
      deprecated_features:
      - Rename variables of ALL roles in the collection to prefix them with __leapp_
        to avoid conflicts with other roles. Older variables names are deprecated
        and will be removed in a future release.
      minor_changes:
      - Add a remediation for the "Legacy network configuration found" inhibitor on
        the RHEL 9 to 10 upgrade path.
      - Add a remediation for the "cgroups-v1 enabled on the system" inhibitor on
        the RHEL 9 to 10 upgrade path.
      - Add a test for the cifs shares remediation.
      - Add remediation role to move /usr directory to root partition when upgrading
        from RHEL 6 to 7.
      - Add support for metalink field in custom repository definitions.
      - Add test for unsupported kernel modules remediation.
      - Add unit test for the leapp_old_postgresql_data remediation.
      - Add warning about limited ongoing technical support for RHEL 6 upgrades.
      - Do not output information about included custom repositories to avoid exposing
        URLs.
      - Enable the remediate role for the RHEL 9 to 10 upgrade path.
      - Ensure job_name is defined in all tests.
      - Fix jinja warnings - use default variables for lists instead of jinja.
      - Fix the post-upgrade on-demand update so that it will not execute if there
        are no post-upgrade repositories specified.
      - Get default remediations by reading files from remediation tasks directory.
      - Move common variables from analysis and upgrade into common.
      - Move parse_leapp_report to common role instead of being a standalone role.
      - Refactor code to remove some ansible-lint warnings and errors.
      - Refactor kernel modules management into common manage_kernel_modules.yml task.
      - Refactor remediations - extract common code into remediation main.yml - use
        conditionals/blocks instead of fail/rescue for flow control.
      - Remove extra collection dependencies from readmes and collection-requirements.yml
        files.
      - Remove leapp-upgrade package before each test to ensure role will install
        it.
      - Remove leapp_inhibitors from vars file - it is a set_fact.
      - Remove outdated (pre-upgrade) bootloader kernel entries.
      - Remove roles/upgrade/meta/argument_spec.yml because it listed only a single
        outdated variable.
      - Remove roles/upgrade/meta/collection-requirements.yml because meta/collection-requirements.yml
        should be on the collection root level only.
      - Remove the dependency on the community.general.archive module.
      - Remove the dependency on the community.general.rhsm_repository module.
      - Remove the dependency on the community.general.yum_versionlock module.
      - Rename leapp_infra_upgrade_system_roles_collection to a shorter and preciser
        leapp_system_roles_collection.
      - Renamed Satellite activation key variables for clarity. ``leapp_satellite_activation_key_leapp``
        is now ``leapp_satellite_activation_key``, ``leapp_satellite_activation_key_pre_leapp``
        is now ``leapp_satellite_activation_key_post_analysis``, and ``leapp_satellite_activation_key_post_leapp``
        is now ``leapp_satellite_activation_key_post_upgrade``. The old variables
        are now deprecated.
      - Replace ansible.posix.mount module with the storage system role
      - Replace ansible.posix.selinux module with the selinux system role
      - Replace community.general.redhat_subscription module with the rhc system role.
      - Set SR_ANSIBLE_INJECT_FACT_VARS to false by default in the CI.
      - Updated remediate role to search for Leapp inhibitors by key first, with a
        fallback to title search. This improves search reliability when report titles
        are modified by Leapp.
      - Variables for pre-upgrade and post-upgrade Satellite activation keys now default
        to the upgrade activation key, making them optional but recommended.
      - Vendor community.general.modprobe module as infra.leapp.modprobe to remove
        dependency on community.general collection.
      - refactor - handle INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS=false by using ansible_facts instead
      - sshd_remediation - remove when condition from sshd_remediation.yml which prevents
        the issue where the analysis role flags an inhibitor for sshd_config during
        a RHEL 8 to RHEL 9 upgrade but the remediation role skips it as it's not RHEL
        7
      - upgrade - Replaced the post_7_to_8_python_interpreter variable with leapp_post_upgrade_python_interpreter
        that affects Ansible interpreter used after a leapp upgrade to execute post-upgrade
        tasks. This change leaves the original variable functional, however, it is
        considered deprecated.

bugfixes:
  - Add leapp_infra_upgrade_system_roles_collection to roles where it's applicable. Both to README and defaults/main.yml.
minor_changes:
  - Remove extra collection dependencies from readmes and collection-requirements.yml files.
  - Remove roles/upgrade/meta/argument_spec.yml because it listed only a single outdated variable.
  - Remove roles/upgrade/meta/collection-requirements.yml because meta/collection-requirements.yml should be on the collection root level only.

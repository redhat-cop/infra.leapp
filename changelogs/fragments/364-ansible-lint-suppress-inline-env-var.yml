minor_changes:
  - Suppress inline-env-var error in leapp_relative_symlinks remediation.
  - This is only needed because Automation Hub is using ansible-lint 24.12.2 for gating,
  - which throws an inline-env-var error here because it cannot tell if the context
  - contains an envvar=value specification.  Note that the current version of ansible-lint
  - 26.* does not throw this error.

# Analysis

The `analysis` role is used to create the Leapp pre-upgrade report on the target hosts. It also saves a copy of the current ansible facts under the `/etc/ansible/facts.d` directory for validation after upgrade.

The role is considered minimally invasive and hopefully will fly under the radar of your enterprise change management policy. That said, it does install the RHEL rpm packages that provide the Leapp framework if they are not already present. While application impact is very low, it may require a change ticket depending on how pedantic your policies are.

This role will not fail if there are inhibitors found, it will throw a warning. However, there is a fact available `upgrade_inhibited` which indicates whether the upgrade will be inhibited or not and you can choose to fail your own playbook using this variable.

## Generated remediations

Analysis role generates hostvars files for each node that runs pre-upgrade.
It reads pre-upgrade reports and matches found inhibitors to available remediations provided by the `remediation` role.

`analysis` role creates the directory `host_vars` in the path from which you run your analysis playbook.
It generates variable files that set the `leapp_remediation_todo` variable with available remediations for existing inhibitors, based on each node's pre-upgrade report.

The role also generates a `remediate.yml` playbook that you can run to run remediation for all nodes.

## Role variables

| Name               | Type   | Default value | Description |
|--------------------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| leapp_upgrade_type | String | "cdn"         | Set to "cdn" for hosts registered with Red Hat CDN, "rhui" for hosts using rhui repos, "satellite" for hosts registered to Satellite, and "custom" for custom repos. |

## Satellite variables

Activation keys provide a method to identify content views available from Red Hat Satellite. To do in-place upgrades using Satellite, both the current RHEL version and the next RHEL version repositories must be available. These variables are **optional** — if `leapp_satellite_organization` and `leapp_satellite_activation_key` are left empty (the default), the satellite registration is skipped and the system is expected to already be registered to the correct content view for the upgrade. If both variables are provided, the collection will register the system using the specified activation key. In case the system uses a different content view than the one used for the upgrade, one can specify the `leapp_satellite_activation_key_post_analysis` in order to register to it after the analysis concludes, leaving the system in its original state. If not specified, the system will remain registered to the `leapp_satellite_activation_key` used during the analysis. The post-analysis registration is also skipped if the organization or post-analysis activation key is empty.

| leapp_satellite_activation_key_post_analysis | String | leapp_satellite_activation_key | Activation key for the current RHEL version content view to register to after analysis. |

# Analysis

The `analysis` role is used to create the Leapp pre-upgrade report on the target hosts. It also saves a copy of the current ansible facts under the `/etc/ansible/facts.d` directory for validation after upgrade.

The role is considered minimally invasive and hopefully will fly under the radar of your enterprise change management policy. That said, it does install the RHEL rpm packages that provide the Leapp framework if they are not already present. While application impact is very low, it may require a change ticket depending on how pedantic your policies are.

## Role variables

# Upgrade

The `upgrade` role is used to kick off the Leapp OS upgrade on the target host. During the execution of this task, the host will be rebooted more than once. After the Leapp OS upgrade is finished, the role will perform some basic validation tests to determine if the OS was upgraded successfully.

Additionally a list of any non-Red Hat RPM packages that were installed on the server prior to the upgrade but were removed during the upgrade will be saved as a set of local facts in `/etc/ansible/facts.d`
